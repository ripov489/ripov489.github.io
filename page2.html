    <em>Write a program using the English language which produces a composition via a set of intructions. Your instructions should be simple enough that they could be executed by any of your classmates within the context of the classroom. Your resulting composition should be something that you find beautiful. Execute your program at least three times before we meet again. Consider how the final output might vary (or not) depending on how your progam is written.</em>

    <strong>Instructions</strong>
        <p>Start out with a piece of paper horizontal. With a pen or pencil, draw a horizontal line going across the middle of the page. In the middle, draw an arch that is approximately 2 inches long that sits above the line you just constructed. Under the arch, about a half-inch below the line, draw a horizontal curvy line the same length as the arch. Centered under that line, draw a similar line that is shorter in length. Repeat this step until you have reached the bottom of the page. It should represent a upside down triangle shape. Now, about three inches above and to the right of the arch draw a large puffy, oval-like shape. To the left of the arch draw a small v that is wide and curved. </p>
